Click a continent to move to any area of the globe, and click on any location to see an up-to-date analysis of the country's Covid-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries. In the future, I plan to expand this app to show more viruses and diseases, such as the Flu. I also plan to incorporate Covid geo-based news stories on Covid as soon as I complete the search filter logic.",

The timing logic is written to color green blocks for future hours, red blocks for the present hour, and grey blocks for past hours. I plan to expand this app as a two-year planner.",

Simply enter the ISBN number from the book you want to post and the Goodreads API will pull all the data (including the cover image), which is then featured on your profile. Users can also find books to borrow using the All Books search engine. We plan to expand this by allowing the user to post books also by scanning the bar code.",

The app basically enables users to set parameters for a password (number of characters, whether to include numbers or special characters, etc.) and the app uses those parameters to generate a random password. I plan to improve the design and may add more functions so that I can write enough text to fill this box out with a length consistent to the other projects. Maybe I'll add a button that allows you to copy the password for pasting. That should make this text long enough.",
