        "description": "I wrote and produced this video to explain how a Virtual Reality (VR) exhibit was used in mediation to secure a successful settlement. The case involved a young boy's very significant visual impairment that resulted from a repeatedly misdiagnosed brain tumor. We worked with expert ophthalmologists to accurately calibrate the child's damaged vision, and because the young boy was passionate about baseball, we created a VR replica of Yankee Stadium as the setting for defense attorneys and insurance adjusters to experience his lifelong impairment.",

        "description": "After our clients won this case involving a deadly explosion at a zinc metal plant, I interviewed the attorneys who worked on the case, and produced this video explaining how our animations visually supported their efforts. Viewer Warning: the animations are extremely graphic. It's noteworthy to mention that the interview for this video was conducted via teleconference, which required me to direct the the attorneys step-by-step on setting up the green screen, lighting, and cameras.",

For marketing purposes, I produced this video explaining how our Digital Injury Summary helped the attorney win the case. I interviewed the attorney, edited the footage, and selected visuals and animations from the presentation that showed the victimâ€™s pain and suffering as his leg was amputated over the course of several complex surgeries. The case resulted in a $35M verdict, and the marketing video motivated several more clients to request Digital Injury Summaries for their cases.",
