        "description": "I worked with a team of doctors and animators to produce this 3D coronavirus animation that accurately demonstrates how Covid-19 impacts the human respiratory system on the cellular level, while educating the public on the symptoms of Covid-19. In addition to working on the animation, I was in charge of distributing the video to the media, to our email subscribers, and on our online channels. The video garnered more than one million views and visual screenshots from the video were featured in news stories from multiple media outlets.",

        "description": "The Digital Injury Summary is a High Impact presentation software that is customized to help attorneys present catastrophic injuries using whatever dynamic visual methods they wanted. I've worked on visuals for several of these projects, which are usually organized by 1) summarizing the injury, 2) demonstrating the surgeries needed, and 3) concluding with the ongoing pain management treatment and impairments the victim carries with them for life. This particular exhibit in the video received the 2018 Award of Excellence from the Association of Medical Illustrators.",

        "description": "Accident reconstruction involves the collection of real-world data to accurately demonstrate a near-perfect representation of what happened. Working at High Impact, we would take that data (sometimes travel to the scene to collect it first-hand using 3D LiDAR  scanners) and then recreate a 3D visual animation of the collision from virtually any angle or perspective. I produced this demo reel showing our most devestating animations.",

My contributions were focused on simplifying complex talking points into animated infographics, which I produced for several of the videos we created for the client. I was also involved in writing the script and editing interview footage.",

        "description": "Imagine if instead of merely observing evidence from the jury box, jurors were able to experience evidence first-hand. Working at High Impact, we used real-world data to accurately visualize evidence for trial and mediation using illustration, animation, and interactive programming. Our virtual reality exhibits utilized skills from every department to build intense virtual worlds that would immerse attorneys and jurors in situational realities. I feel proud to have been involved in the first known use of virtual reality to win a mediation (featured in the video section of my portfolio).",
