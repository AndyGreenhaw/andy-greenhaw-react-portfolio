        "description": "While trying to find a job in a science-related field, I created this animation to include in my job hunt, which helped me get invited to the National Space Symposium, and attain a job in the very scientific field of legal visuals. I took Neil Degrasse Tyson's appearance from the Rogan Podcast, edited his words into lyrics that rhymed, and timed it to Wax Taylor. After I edited the lyrics into a song, I animated what it said, and it came out looking great."

        "description": "I wrote and produced this animation for the U.S. Air Force while working for Hangar 30, a digital services agency that specializes in apps, animations, websites, and visuals for military clients. An Air Force colonel wanted to show the future of combat in a presentation about cyberwarfare, and he needed a mind-blowing intro video to prime the audience. I wrote, animated and edited everything in one week. The video resulted in our company receiving contracts for similar videos for SOCOM, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and National Defense University.",

The video was used throughout their online material, including the web portal to download the report, and the video was featured on about fifty screens throughout the 2015 Space Symposium. I was asked to repurpose the same video for them to use with the 2016 Space Report.",

        "description": "After producing the Age of Surprise video for the Air Force, the Defense Intelligence Agency wanted a similar animation that would help them simplify the complicated message of what the DIA does. I animated the intro section (first minute 1:40 of the video above) using an infographic style to build a crescendo of dark talking points the DIA wanted conveyed. Another artist animated the remainder of the video featuring high-intensity facts about the DIA with three-dimensional graphics.",
